    <h1>COVID-19 and Its Impact On The World</h1>


<p>For the first time in this century, the world is facing a health crisis that has affected every human being on this planet in some way or another.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 has forged greater cooperation between nations. We are learning from each other and trying to contain this dreaded disease before it claims more lives.</p>

<p>However, it is true that it has disrupted our lives like never before.</p>

<p>So, let us take a look at the wide-ranging impact COVID-19 has had on our planet.</p>





<h3>COVID-19 – The Negative Effects</h3>




<p>China, which has tided over the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, is drowning under the waste it generated during its fight against the virus. It is grappling with large-scale disposal of tonnes of masks, protective gear, hazmat suits (hazardous materials suits) medicines, foils and containers etc. This medical waste disposal problem is something that most countries will soon have to contend with.</p>

<p>7 big cats in the Bronx Zoo have tested positive for COVID-19. This raises the possibility that animals too may get infected. Zoos across the world are testing animals and disinfecting their enclosures to keep them safe.</p>

<p>More than 18.6 lakh people have been infected globally and 1.15 lakh people have lost their lives.<p>

<p>Global economy has gone into a recession with minimal industrial activity.</p>

<p>Experts have said that many people will lose jobs globally.</p>





<h3>COVID-19 – The Positive Effects</h3>


<p>While COVID-19 has many negatives for the world, it has benefited nature in a few ways.</p>

<p>Seismic noise (noise and vibrations made by human activity) has dropped. With no noise emanating from cars and buses, noise pollution too is no longer plaguing us.</p>

<p>Air quality index in every country has improved. Cars are off the roads. Similarly, air travel has become minimal. According to calculations by the Climate Group, this will produce 30 million tonnes of carbon emission less this year.</p>

<p>In China, the most polluted country in the world, air pollution level has dropped by 25%. According to research by Stanford University, this could save the lives of 4000 children under the age of 5 and 73,000 adults over the age of 70.</p>

<p>The international lens is on the illegal marketing of wildlife. It is believed that COVID-19 originated from a market where wildlife is sold and slaughtered. Wildlife conservationists are urging governments of all countries to take firm action against poaching of wild animals and wildlife consumption.</p>
